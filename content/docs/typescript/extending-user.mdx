description: How to extend the User type

Internally, LucidAuth defines a `BaseUser` interface with a standard set of properties:

```typescript
export interface BaseUser {
  id?: string | null;
  name?: string | null;
  email?: string | null;
  image?: string | null;
  role?: string | null;
}

export interface User extends BaseUser {}
```

In your application, you might need additional properties available in the user session data. For example, let's say you have added a `subscriptionId` to your session payload so you can access it via `session.user.subscriptionId`.

However, if you try to access this property in your code, TypeScript will show an error because `subscriptionId` is not defined in the default `BaseUser` interface.

To resolve this, you can use a TypeScript feature called **module augmentation**. This allows you to "merge" your custom properties into the existing library definition.

In your project root, create a file named `lucidauth.d.ts` and add the following code:

```typescript title="lucidauth.d.ts"
import "lucidauth/core/types";

declare module "lucidauth/core/types" {
  interface BaseUser {
    subscriptionId?: string;
  }
}
```

What's happening here?

First, we import the file where the `BaseUser` type is defined inside the library. Then, we use the `declare module` syntax to tell TypeScript that we are modifying that specific module.

Inside the module, we re-declare the `BaseUser` interface with only the new properties. TypeScript automatically merges this definition with the original one inside the library.

Now, `BaseUser` includes the `subscriptionId` property, and TypeScript knows it exists. As a result, accessing `session.user.subscriptionId` in your code will no longer trigger type errors.
