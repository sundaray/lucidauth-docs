title: User Session Strategy
description: User session strategy supported by LucidAuth
---

Authentication libraries typically offer two user session strategies: **JWT** and **Database**.

In the JWT strategy, user session information such as id, name, role, and expiry are stored in a JWT, which is stored in a cookie. In the Database strategy, user session information is stored in a database; the cookie stores only the session ID.

The browser automatically sends the cookie with every request to the server. On the server, you extract the cookie from the request header. If the value stored is a JWT, you verify (or decrypt) it to get back the user session information. If the value stored is a session ID, you make a database call and fetch the user session information associated with that ID.

Currently, LucidAuth supports **only the JWT user session strategy**. Specifically, it **uses encrypted JWTs** (JWE), making it **safe to store confidential information** in the user session.

<Callout title="Note">
  A JWT can be either signed or encrypted. 
  
  A signed JWT (JWS) ensures **integrity**. Its payload is readable by anyone, but cannot be modified
  without invalidating the signature. 
  
  An encrypted JWT (JWE) ensures **both confidentiality and integrity**. Its payload is unreadable to everyone except
  those possessing the correct decryption key, and any modification to the token will cause decryption to fail.
