## Obtaining Google OAuth 2.0 Credentials

Follow the steps below to create a project in the Google Cloud console and obtain OAuth 2.0 credentials, which authenticate your application to Google’s OAuth 2.0 server.

<Steps>
<Step>
 
### Create a Project
1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. On the main navigation bar at the top, to the left of the search box, you’ll see the project selector. Click it to open a dialog listing all your projects. In the dialog click **New project**.
3. Enter a project name and click **Create**. Once the project is created, click **Select project**. The project’s name should appear in the project selector.
4. Next, click the hamburger menu on the top-left corner of the page to open the sidebar navigation, then navigate to **APIs & services** > **OAuth consent screen**.

</Step>

<Step>
  ### OAuth consent screen 
  1. On the OAuth overview page, click **Get started**.
  2. Under **App information**, enter your app name and user support email, then click **Next**. 
  3. Select **External** as the audience type (This setting
  makes your project accessible to anyone with a Google account.), then click **Next**. 
  4. Under **Contact Information**, enter your email address, then click **Next**. 
  5. Select the checkbox labeled **I agree to the Google API
  services user data policy**, then click **Continue**. 
  6. Click **Create**. 
  7. You should see a toast notification with the message **OAuth configuration created**.

### OAuth credentials

1. Click the hamburger menu in the top-left corner of the page to open the sidebar navigation, then navigate to **APIs & services** > **Credentials**.
2. On the **Credentials** page, click **+Create credentials** to open the dropdown menu. Click **OAuth client ID**.
3. Select **Web application** as the application type. Then, enter a name for your OAuth 2.0 client in the **Name** field. (This name is used only to identify the client in the console and is not shown to end users.)
4. Under **Authorized JavaScript origins**, click Add URI and enter `http://localhost:3000`. This URI is the HTTP origin that hosts your web application. Note: When you deploy your app to production, you will need to come back here and add your live domain, e.g., `https://your-domain.com`.
5. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, enter `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`. This URI is the endpoint in your application where the Google OAuth server will send responses to your authentication requests. Note: When you deploy your app to production, you will need to come back here and add your live callback URL, e.g., `https://your-domain.com/api/auth/callback/google`.

   <Callout title="Note">
     The authorized redirect URI must exactly match
     `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`. LucidAuth requires this
     specific endpoint to verify and process the authorization code sent from
     the Google authorization server.
   </Callout>

6. Click **Create**.
7. After the OAuth client is created, a dialog appears with the title **OAuth client created**. In the dialog you’ll see both the **Client ID** and **Client secret** details. Copy both and store them securely; you'll need these credentials in the next section when setting up environment variables.
